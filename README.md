# Github Finder - Example React.js Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It consists mainly of a Github Finder application, where you can find and view users and their public repository information.

It was built step-by-step by me as part of the learning process for the course [React Front To Back](https://www.udemy.com/modern-react-front-to-back) from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com).

## How to Run
```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Running Tests
```
npm test
```

## Applying ESLint
```
npm run format-code
```

## Building (Bundle & Minify)
```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
